    **Linking companies using the Busy on-premise connector**

    The Busy on-premise connector must be run on the same computer as the Busy application. Advise your user to install the connector on the computer they normally use when working with the Busy application.

    Before beginning the syncing process, it is important that the user first opens the Busy application and logs in to the specific company they wish to link. This is a critical step as it establishes the necessary connection between the Busy application and the on-premise connector, enabling seamless transfer of financial data between the two platforms.

    **Supported Environments**

    Our Busy on-premise connector is specifically designed to operate in single-tenant environments. This means that only one Windows user can log on to a particular computer, which is also used to access the Busy application.
