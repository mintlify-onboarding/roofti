#### Company Linked Webhook

The Company Linked Webhook fires when a connection is successfully linked to an invite link. 

#### Sync Completed Webhook

The Sync Completed Webhook fires when an asynchronous sync is completed. This occurs when you [trigger a sync](/docs/syncing-data) for the company or when you [write asynchronous data](/docs/asynchronous-writes). 

#### Data Model Changes Webhook

You need to further configure the Event Types for the Data Model Changes Webhook

1. **CREATE:** This type of event will be called when the data is synced for the first time or when a new record is pulled from Accounting Platform.
2. **UPDATE:**This type of event will be called only when the data changes (not everytime RootFi syncs data). So, even if RootFi syncs data everyday but data has not changed on Accounting platform, you will not be notified through a webhook.
3. **DELETE**: This type of event will be called if data is deleted on the Accounting platform. This webhook will be called only if a `full_sync` has been performed.

You can select the data models you want this webhook to fire for. You can select certain data models from the dropdown or select all.

### Developer Reference

<Note>
    **Webhooks are retried**

    Webhooks will be retried 3 times with an exponential delay. So, even if your server is busy due to large number of requests, there's no worry of loosing data ðŸ˜ƒ.

    Webhooks will be triggered with a **POST** request in the following body:
