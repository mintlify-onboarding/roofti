### Overview

Our Link allows you to deliver an in-browser experience without requiring any front-end code.

The Link experience is sent to your end users via a secure URL.

Benefits:

* Fast proof of concept of RootFi without making frontend changes to embed Connect into your app
* Your users can authorize integrations without logging into your platform i.e sending URLs via email

### Generate Connect Link

A Connect Link can be generated in two ways:

1. From your RootFi dashboard (basic)
2. Programmatically via API (Intermediate)

#### Dashboard

You can initialize a Link from the RootFi Dashboard in three easy steps.

1. Navigate to Companies in the left navigation
2. On the top right corner of the page, click the button to Invite a Company
3. Click Generate URL, and copy the URL

That's it! You will be presented with a unique URL that you can send to your customer.
