title: "Unified Error Messages"
description: "Work in Progress. Please report any inconsistencies"

When writing data there are several aspects of why an API can error out. You could be missing a required field, you could pass an incorrect ID, or you could be duplicating a unique value. Each platform has their own error codes and error messages. 

We have tried to unify the responses of these write apis to help debug these potential errors that could occur using our write APIs. 

Below are a list of error codes you can expect along with the error message. We also will return a `platform_error` field which will contain the error message thrown by the platform. This is useful in cases where our error code is `UNKOWN_ERROR`

| Error Code              | Error Message                                 | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MISSING\_PARAMS         | Missing required field: field\_name           | If a required field field\_name is missing. Eg: Name of an account                                                                                                                     |
| INVALID\_PARAMS         | Invalid field: field\_name                    | If a certain field, field\_name, is invalid. Eg: GST number is not formatted correctly                                                                                                 |
| RECORD\_NOT\_FOUND      | Data not found with given: field\_name        | If a record could not be found with the given ID of the field\_name. Eg: An incorrect contact\_id was passed when creating an invoice                                                  |
| RECORD\_ALREADY\_EXISTS | Record already exists with given: field\_name | If a record already exists with the given value of the field\_name. Eg: Trying to create a customer with the same name                                                                 |
| OPERATION\_DENIED       | Operation Denied: message                     | If the operation cannot be completed. Eg: If you create an invoice using an inactive customer or make an excess payment to an already closed invoice                                   |
| RATE\_LIMIT\_EXCEEDED   | Rate limit exceeded                           | When using our synchronous write api, the rate limit can be exceeded. You should try again after 1 minute                                                                              |
| UNKNOWN\_ERROR          | Unknown error                                 | if we cannot understand the error from the accounting platform. In such cases you should see the platform\_error. We will be monitoring such cases and actively fixing them over time. |
