The process to setup Sage (ZA) differs from the other Accounting Integrations. You will need your end customer to request an API key from Sage Za team. The end customer (aka your customer) will then need to enter this api key when you invite them to connect their company via the RootFi Connect Link/SDK Screen..  
These steps are outlined in greater detail below.
