title: "Phone Number"
description: "**The Phone Number Sub Data Model** is designed to streamline and standardize the handling of phone number information across different accounting platforms."
---

As a sub data model, it is always referenced by another data model, such as [company info](/docs/company-info). This structure allows for efficient organisation and retrieval of phone number information, ensuring a streamlined approach to handling phone number related data.

* Unified phone number representation: The model standardises data across different accounting platforms, simplifying access and management of phone number information.
* Linked to other data models: Each phone number entry is connected to a specific [data model](/docs/enums#data-models) and includes the `platform_id` of that data model for easy cross-referencing.
* Versatile phone number types: The data model supports three distinct phone number types, including mobile, telephone, and fax, catering to different communication requirements.
