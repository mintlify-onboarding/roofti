title: "External Link"
---

**The External Link Sub Data Model** is designed to store and manage internet links related to various entities within your accounting integrations. This unified model helps to simplify and streamline the handling of external link information.

As a sub data model, it is always referenced by another data model, such as [company info](/docs/company-info). This structure allows for efficient organisation and retrieval of external links information, ensuring a streamlined approach to handling external link related data.

* Unified external link representation: The model standardises data across different accounting platforms, simplifying access and management of external link information.
* Linked to other data models: Each external link entry is connected to a specific [data model](/docs/enums#data-models) and includes the `platform_id` of that data model for easy cross-referencing.
* Versatile link types: The model supports two distinct types of external links, including websites and email addresses, allowing for diverse and relevant connections.
