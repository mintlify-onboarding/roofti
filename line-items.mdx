title: "Line Items"

**The Line Item Sub Data Model** is designed to standardise and simplify the representation of individual line items across various accounting documents and platforms.

As a sub data model, it is always referenced by another data model, such as bills or invoices. This structure allows for efficient organisation and retrieval of address information, ensuring a streamlined approach to handling address-related data.

* Unified line item representation: The model standardises data across different accounting platforms, simplifying access and management of line item information.
* Multiple data model support: The Line Item data model can be linked from a range of data models, such as [bills](/docs/bills), [invoices](/docs/invoices), [invoice credit notes](/docs/invoice-credit-notes), [bill credit notes](/docs/bill-credit-notes), [expenses](/docs/expenses), [purchase orders](/docs/purchase-orders), and [sales orders](/docs/sales-orders), providing a unified structure for diverse use cases.
* Calculated values: Pre-tax subtotals, tax amounts, and total amounts are included in the data model, streamlining financial calculations and document summaries.
