RootFi uses an `api_key` to control access to our API via [HTTP Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%5Faccess%5Fauthentication). You can find and create your keys in your [dashboard ](https://integrate.rootfi.dev/).

### Your First API is ready for you

When you create an account with Rootfi, we automatically generate your API keys to facilitate secure and seamless communication between your application and our platform.

 These API keys are essential for authenticating your requests and enabling access to our unified accounting integrations.

To access your API keys, follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to your Rootfi account.
2. Navigate to the "Settings" left navigation menu.
3. Select "API Keys" from the top navigation menu.

On the "API Keys" page, you'll find your unique API key. To copy it, simply click the "Copy" Icon.

### Making API Requests

With your API key in hand, you're ready to authenticate your requests and start leveraging Rootfi's powerful features to streamline your accounting integrations. Remember to keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly, as they grant access to your Rootfi account and connected data.

When making an API request to the server, RootFi expects your `api_key` in the headers of the request. 

For example, if your `api_key` is "xxx-xxx-xxx" the header will contain:  
`api_key: xxx-xxx-xxx`

For all requests to get business data, you must add an `api_key` key with a value of `api_key`, in the header of the request.

<Warning>
    **Your API key should be private**

    Make sure your `api_key` isn't available in publicly accessible areas, such as GitHub or client-side code
