By default RooFi unifies and caches all data that is synced for all companies. We internally link the primary keys of all related data models together providing you with a seamless ability to query deeply nested objects together.

### Disabling Save Data

If for regulatory concerns or otherwise, you do not want RootFi to cache the sync data you have the option. 

Go to Webhooks section from the Settings page and disable the 'Save Data' toggle. 

**Make sure to enable a Data Model changes webhook, so you can receive all the synced data**
