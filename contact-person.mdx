title: "Contact Person"

**The Contact Person Sub Data Model** is designed to efficiently represent and manage contact person information related to customers in various accounting platforms.

As a sub data model, it is always referenced by another data model. For this data model it is always linked to the [contacts data model](/docs/contacts). This structure allows for efficient organisation and retrieval of contact details, ensuring a streamlined approach to handling contact person related data.

* Unified contact representation: The model standardises data across different accounting platforms, simplifying access and management of contact information.
* Linked to [contacts](/docs/contacts): Each contact person entry is connected to a specific contact, with the `contact_id` property enabling easy cross-referencing and organisation.
* Support for phone number data: The phone\_numbers property links to a dedicated phone number data model, allowing for more structured and detailed storage of contact phone numbers.
