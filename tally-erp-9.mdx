    **Linking companies using the Tally on-premise connector**

    The Tally on-premise connector must be run on the same computer as the Tally application. Advise your user to install the connector on the computer they normally use when working with the Tally application.

    Before beginning the syncing process, it is important that the user first opens the Tally application and logs in to the specific company they wish to link. This is a critical step as it establishes the necessary connection between the Tally application and the on-premise connector, enabling seamless transfer of financial data between the two platforms.

    **Supported Environments**

    Our Tally on-premise connector is specifically designed to operate in single-tenant environments. This means that only one Windows user can log on to a particular computer, which is also used to access the Tally application.
