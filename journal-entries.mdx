## Journal Lines

**The Journal Lines Data Model** complements the Journal Entries Data Model, focusing on individual transactions within a journal entry.

* Unified journal line properties: The model unifies essential journal line details, such as type, description, net amount, and tax amount, making it easier to work with journal line data from different platforms.
* Hierarchical relationship with journal entries: Journal lines are associated with specific journal entries through the `journal_entry_id` property, enabling a clear understanding of their context within the broader financial record.
* Relationship with other data models: Journal lines are connected to accounts, customers, and taxes using their respective `platform_id` properties, ensuring data consistency and accuracy across different accounting platforms.
