We support easy to use rest apis for all our data models with the following query parameters:

1. take - the number of objects you want to retrieve
2. skip - the index from where you want to start retrieving objects
3. orderBy - a json string you can pass to sort the data
4. filter - a json string you can pass to filter the data

Our [postman collection](/docs/rootfi-postman-collection) shows you how to use these params. Please contact us if you have any questions. 

<Note>
    **Highly recommend GraphQL**

    We highly recommend you [use our GraphQL apis](/docs/graphql-apis) to read data. You have a lot more flexibility and customisability to easily make complex queries to suit your needs.
