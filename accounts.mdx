description: "**The Accounts Data Model** is designed to streamline the management and retrieval of account-related information across various accounting platforms. "

* Unified account properties: The model unifies essential account details, such as name, description, currency, and current balance, making it easier to work with account data from different platforms.
* Hierarchical structure: Accounts can be linked to parent accounts using the `parent_account_id`, enabling the representation of complex account structures and relationships.
* Categorisation and status: The model supports account categorisation with main categories and subcategories, as well as tracking account status for better organisation and reporting.
