## Bulk Writes 2.0
We’ve redesigned the sync logs to support bulk writes. Now, your logs will include the bulk write API calls you’ve made all in one place.

## Tally Improvements: Automated AP/AR
We have linked Invoice Payments and Invoices as well as Bills and Bill Payments. Unlike the simplicity of other accounting platforms, it’s challenging to link these models. There are hidden data models between the two that you need access to link the two models.Now, companies who are interested in automating the Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivable process can leverage the Tally Integration.

## Sneak peek: Wafeq and NetSuite Integrations!
We’re thrilled to have begun piloting both our Wafeq and NetSuite integrations with a few customers. If you’re interested in gaining early access to Wafeq or NetSuite, set up a call with me today!

## Frictionless Pricing
We have automated our pricing plans with Togai and integrated billing with Stripe. This will make billing seamless for our customers.
