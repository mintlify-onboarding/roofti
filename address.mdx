**The Address Sub Data Model** is designed to store and manage address details associated with various accounting entities. 

As a sub data model, it is always referenced by another data model, such as [company info](/docs/company-info). This structure allows for efficient organisation and retrieval of address information, ensuring a streamlined approach to handling address-related data.

* Unified address data model: The model standardises data across different accounting platforms, simplifying access and management of address-related data.
* Linked to other data models: Each address entry is connected to a specific [data model](/docs/enums#data-models) and includes the `platform_id` of that data model for easy cross-referencing.
* Flexible address types: The data model supports three distinct address types, including company, shipping, and billing addresses, accommodating different use cases.
* Geolocation support: The latitude and longitude properties enable geolocation functionality for more accurate address representation and potential mapping applications.
