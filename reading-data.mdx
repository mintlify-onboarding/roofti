### Disabling Save Data

If for regulatory concerns or otherwise, you do not want RootFi to cache the sync data you have the option.

Go to Webhooks section from the Settings page and disable the 'Save Data' toggle.

**Make sure to enable a Data Model changes webhook, so you can receive all the synced data**
