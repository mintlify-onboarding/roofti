The Tally on-premise connector offers users who use Tally an easy and efficient way to share their accounting data through the RootFi Integrate platform. This connector is designed as a Windows application that can be installed on the user's local machine.

You can enable the Tally on-premise connector by enabling the integration from the 'Integrations' page on the RootFi Integrate Dashboard.

The installation process for the Tally on-premise connector requires the user who is connecting their company data to complete the steps provided on the RootFi Connect Link/SDK. These steps must be followed carefully to ensure the successful installation and linking of the required company with the on-premise connector.

> The Tally on-premise connector must be run on the same computer as the Tally Prime application. Advise your user to install the connector on the computer they normally use when working with the Tally Prime application.
> 
> Before beginning the syncing process, it is important that the user first opens the Tally Prime application and logs in to the specific company they wish to link. This is a critical step as it establishes the necessary connection between the Tally Prime application and the on-premise connector, enabling seamless transfer of financial data between the two platforms.

> Our Tally on-premise connector is specifically designed to operate in single-tenant environments. This means that only one Windows user can log on to a particular computer, which is also used to access the Tally Prime application.
